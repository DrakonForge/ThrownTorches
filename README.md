# Thrown Torches

Ever wish you could throw a torch down into a dark abyss to find out what's at the bottom?

Well, that isn't a problem with Hytale's dynamic lighting...but with this simple mod, your torch places
itself as a block so it will never go out!

## Features

**Thrown Torches** adds extra utility to thrown torches, allowing you to illuminate vertical environments
such as ravines with permanent light sources. This works with any handheld torch, as long as it falls far enough and the stack doesn't contain multiple torches.

Torches will not be placed if there is no room, and will never destroy blocks or be placed in a way torches normally cannot.

## Server Customization

Server owners can override the list of items which can be thrown in this way, even extending it to work beyond
torches! Simply create an asset pack which overwrites the `Handheld_Torches` block type list and the mod will adjust accordingly.
